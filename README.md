# Rico
### A Rich Text Editor for basic WYSIWYG HTML editing

Rico is a fork of [Trix](https://github.com/basecamp/rico) that:

    - [x] Removes all attachment and image upload support.
    - [x] Removes all CSS and SVG.
    - [x] Uses <p> instead of <div> for default text blocks.
    - [x] Adds a <h2> button to the toolbar.
    - [ ] Adds a <small> button to the toolbar.
    - [x] Removes the ability to nest <blockquote>
    - [x] Makes pressing shift + enter to insert a <br>.
    - [x] Makes pressing enter to close current scope and add a new one (like a new paragraph).
