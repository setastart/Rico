# Rico
### A Rich Text Editor for WYSIWYG basic HTML editing

Rico is a fork of [Trix](https://github.com/basecamp/trix) that:

    Removes all attachment and image upload support.
    Removes all CSS and SVG.
    Uses <p> instead of <div> for default text blocks.
    Adds a <h2> button to the toolbar.
    Adds a <small> button to the toolbar.
    Makes pressing shift + enter to insert a <br>.
    Makes pressing enter to close current scope and add a new one (like a new paragraph).
